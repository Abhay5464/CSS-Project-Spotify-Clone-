# Spotify Clone
A static clone of the Spotify web player interface created for practicing <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> skills. This project focuses on replicating the design and layout of Spotify's UI without adding functionality.

# Features
1. <b>Sidebar Navigation</b>: Includes links for Home, Search, and Your Library.
2. <b>Button Design</b>: Styled buttons for "Create Playlist," "Browse Podcasts," "Explore Premium," and "Install App."
3. <b>Section Layout</b>:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. "Recently Played" section with visually appealing content cards.
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. "Trending Now Near You" section for showcasing placeholder items.
4. <b>Media Player Bar</b>: A custom footer mimicking Spotify's playback bar design.

# Technologies Used
<b>HTML</b>: Used to structure the layout and components of the web page.
<b>HTML</b>: Used to style the elements, including layout, colors, and typography.

# Purpose
This project was built solely for <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> practice. The buttons and links are non-functional and intended only for visual representation.

# What I Learned
1. Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML.
2. Using CSS for layout and positioning.
3. Creating visually appealing buttons and cards.
4. Mimicking a real-world user interface with only static assets.

# Future Goals
This project serves as a base for potentially adding interactivity using JavaScript or a frontend framework like React in the future.
